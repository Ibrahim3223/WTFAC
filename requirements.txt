# YouTube Shorts Automation - Requirements (Production Ready)
# ============================================================

# --- Core AI/ML (Gemini SDKs) ---
google-genai>=0.2.0           # import: google.genai
google-generativeai>=0.8.3    # import: google.generativeai
# Note: Keep both if unsure which one is used, or remove unused one

# --- Config / Validation / Env ---
pyyaml>=6.0
pydantic>=2.0
python-dotenv>=1.0.0

# --- Text-to-Speech ---
edge-tts>=6.1.0
nest-asyncio>=1.5.0
gtts>=2.5.0

# --- Google APIs (YouTube upload) ---
google-api-python-client>=2.100.0
google-auth-oauthlib>=1.1.0
google-auth>=2.23.0
google-auth-httplib2>=0.1.1

# --- HTTP / Feeds ---
requests>=2.31.0
feedparser>=6.0.0

# --- Image/Video processing ---
Pillow>=10.0.0

# --- Audio/Video utilities ---
pydub>=0.25.0   # Requires FFmpeg runtime (system package)

# --- Numeric / ML toolstack ---
# CRITICAL: numpy MUST be installed BEFORE aeneas (build dependency)
numpy>=1.26,<2
scikit-learn>=1.3.0

# --- ML / Embeddings ---
sentence-transformers>=2.7.0

# --- CLI / Logging (optional but useful) ---
tqdm>=4.66.0
colorlog>=6.8.0

# ============================================================
# Perfect Caption Sync - Bulletproof Forced Alignment
# ============================================================
# CRITICAL: Install numpy first (above), then aeneas
# aeneas requires numpy during build time, not just runtime
aeneas>=1.7.3
# Battle-tested forced alignment for phoneme-level precision (±10ms)
# Aligns known text to audio with perfect synchronization
# Handles pauses, tempo changes, and speech variations flawlessly
# 
# System dependencies required (install via apt/yum):
# - espeak or espeak-ng (TTS engine)
# - libespeak-dev or espeak-ng-dev (development headers)
# - ffmpeg (audio/video processing)
# - python3-dev (Python headers)
#
# Installation on Ubuntu/Debian:
#   sudo apt-get install espeak libespeak-dev ffmpeg python3-dev
#
# Installation on CentOS/RHEL:
#   sudo yum install espeak espeak-devel ffmpeg python3-devel
#
# Verification:
#   python -c "from aeneas.executetask import ExecuteTask; print('✅ aeneas ready!')"

# ============================================================
# Notes:
# ============================================================
# - FFmpeg is required as a system-level binary for pydub and aeneas
# - eSpeak is required as a system-level package for aeneas
# - numpy must be installed BEFORE aeneas (build-time dependency)
# - If only one Gemini SDK is used, the other line can be removed
# - aeneas provides 3-layer fallback: aeneas → TTS timings → estimation
